# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**STATUS: LIVE, POST-LAUNCH, ITERATING ON `main`.** The rebuild is complete and merged. **`main` is production and the single working branch — every push to `main` deploys.** The site is live at prismhealthco.com. The `rebuild` branch is retired and deleted. Outstanding: OG image, FAQ answers, Privacy/Terms, disclaimer, integration list. Do not re-run completed phases.

**Reading this file post-launch:** it was written as a pre-launch build spec, and parts of it still describe intentions the shipped site moved past. **Where this document and the code disagree, the code is correct** — the live site is the source of truth for what Prism is now. Sections reconciled against the code carry a SHIPPED marker; the rest may lag.

This file is the single source of truth. `PRISM_WEBSITE_BRIEF.md` has been merged into it and deleted (recoverable from `main` at commit `72cde1e`).

This is the build specification for the Prism website. It is the single source of truth for structure, copy, brand, and build plan. Do not invent copy, structure, or visuals beyond what is specified. Where a decision is marked "in situ", it is judged by the founder on the live preview, not decided in code.

## 1. What Prism is (context, not live copy)

Prism is a native iOS consumer subscription app (UK launch, late August 2026) that helps users see what changes in their health data after they start, stop or adjust supplements. It connects to Apple Health and wearables and shows trends against a baseline, for example a sleep trend with a marker where Magnesium was started. First trend view appears at day 14. Pricing: £6.99/month, £49.99/year with a 7-day free trial on annual only.

Positioning: category creation. No product today shows whether supplements are working for an individual, non-invasively. The only alternative is blood panels: £250–400, invasive, 40+ markers, requires paid interpretation, and cannot isolate the supplement from other lifestyle changes. Prism shows the user's own data, readably. Prism never claims supplements work or do not work. The user sees the data and decides.

The website sells a new capability, not an app. Its one job: make this belief land — "I can finally see whether my supplements are working." Every section is judged against: does it increase belief that this capability is real? If a section does not, it gets cut.

## 2. What the website is and is not

**Page model (structural revision 2026-07-17 — supersedes the original "pinned phone demonstration" shape, which is dead; do not resurrect it):**

- One continuous scrollable page built as **self-contained panels** — the App Store model on a webpage. Not a multi-page site.
- Each panel: full-width colour band, one message, one headline moment, self-contained like an App Store card. **No pinning, no scroll-driven screen swapping, no content morphing.** Story through logical sequence, not linkage.
- **Two-mode chaptering (correction, 2026-07-17 — supersedes the single continuous dark canvas, which was wrong):** the page is chaptered by alternating **LIGHT** and **DARK** panel modes, colour doing the section separation — no divider lines. DARK = the black → deep-green gradient (`#000000` → `#0A3C0A`) with white type. LIGHT = soft cream (not pure white) with near-black type. Green `#3AB203` is an ACCENT in both modes (headline accent words, small elements) and is **never a background colour**.
- **Colour registers: THREE registers, not rigid alternation.** (1) **Gradient-dark, leaning GREEN** — the brand fade pushed richer green (`#000000`→`#114f15`, black at one edge, NOT a flat green wall): P1, P3, P5. P3 and P5 read distinctly green and **frame P4** (green→jet-black→green). (2) **Jet black** — flat `#000000`: P4 (the standout, framed by the green panels — that framing is what makes it stand out, not being the only black on the page). (3) **Near-white cream** — `#FCFBF8`: P2, P6. Green `#3AB203` stays a sparing accent, never a background. **P7 FAQ+footer is flat black** (it was always black; a black footer at the very bottom, not adjacent to P4, doesn't undercut P4's green framing). Register order: P1 grad-green · P2 cream · P3 grad-green · P4 jet-black · P5 grad-green · P6 cream · P7 black.
- **Contrast rule:** no washed grey secondary text. Supporting copy is high-contrast in both modes (near-white on dark, near-black on cream). Every line clearly legible.
- Panels transition at clean band edges — built as **hard colour changes** (closest-match call, flagged; a very short fade is the alternative if the hard cut reads harsh on preview).
- Panel grammar (from Levels/Oura): small-caps eyebrow label (**REQUIRED on every panel except the hero** — quiet, above the headline, naming the section's job; same treatment in both modes) → large display headline (green accent word where locked) → short supporting copy → content. Generous vertical air. Alternating composition where a panel has a visual.
- Quality bar: **Oura/Levels-grade restraint and finish.**

Unchanged:

- The site gathers no user input except one waitlist email field. No quiz, no goal selectors, no sign-up, no onboarding. All onboarding lives in the app.
- The narrative is the App Store narrative, promoted. The website introduces no new ideas.
- App screens appear only per the §2.1 screens allowance (device-framed split-panel supporting visuals). Never mock up or invent UI. No lifestyle photography. No stock imagery. No supplement-shop composition.
- Copy pattern: every headline is a capability the user gains (Know / See / Change), never a description of software.

### 2.1 Visual vocabulary (addendum, 2026-07-17 — applies to all panels)

What may appear:

- **Cropped UI fragments from the real screens in `brief-assets/`** (trend line, Magnesium marker, stage dial, etc.) as visual anchors — crops of real screens only, **never recompositions of UI that doesn't exist as shown**. Test: could a user see exactly this in the app?
- **The wearable strip as a designed brand row (Fix 5):** recognisable brand wordmarks for Apple Watch, WHOOP, Oura, Garmin — text-based wordmark styling; never fabricate logos that cannot be rendered accurately.
- **Typography-as-visual — preferred where a panel needs no anchor.**

Never: photography of people or nature, stock imagery, generated imagery.

**Screens allowance (correction round, Fix 4 — lifts the one-screen restriction):** real App Store screens from `brief-assets/` may appear **contained in device frames as split-panel supporting visuals**, Levels-style. In use: `Home.png` (Panel 3), `Progress 1.png` (Panel 4). Crops must remain straight viewport crops of real screens. (The `trend.png` crop was retired by the consolidated round — P2's slot holds a human-imagery placeholder instead.)

**Human imagery (consolidated round):** two placeholder sites — P2's visual slot, and a strip of three under P5's strap (your body / your goals / your results) — rendered as grey blocks labelled "HUMAN VISUAL TBD". Founder supplies direction later. Never source or generate imagery.

### 2.2 Composition system (addendum — how things are arranged)

A small fixed layout vocabulary, varied across panels so **no two consecutive panels use the same arrangement**:

- **Split panel** — copy one side, contained visual the other; alternate sides down the page.
- **Stacked panel** — headline/copy above, visual or visual-row below.
- **Statement panel** — full-width pure typography (Bridge and Trust are this).
- **Full-bleed visual moment** — used sparingly.

System rules: every visual sits in a consistent container (uniform corner radius, treatment); **one grid governs the whole page** — identical margins, gutters, and spacing rhythm across all panels; variation happens in arrangement only, never in the system. Alternate compositions for visual rhythm; keep hierarchy identical: eyebrow (required except hero) → headline → support → content.

Composition map — **P1 and P6 RECONCILED against the code 2026-08-23; the rest is as specced and not re-verified.** **P1 hero: copy is LEFT-aligned at desktop**, centred only at mobile widths. This **supersedes the P5-round "Centred: P1 ONLY" rule**, which the built page inverted. **P6 Get Prism: CENTRED at all widths** (`items-center text-center`, robin hood 3 per §2.3) — it is the page's centred conversion moment, not the left-aligned block this map used to describe. **P2:** stacked — text block above, one WIDE landscape image below at full content width (Whoop horizontal pattern; the page's only landscape image, breaking P3/P4's portrait rhythm). **Split alternating (text left-aligned in its column):** P3 text RIGHT / visual left · P4 text LEFT / visual right. **P5:** entire panel left-aligned (Whoop pattern). **P7:** left-aligned questions list. Every split panel has a visual slot opposite its text.

**Headline-scale calibration (P5 round):** display size for one-line statements, stepped down for multi-line headlines. The hero (P1) is the singular display PEAK (its own larger scale). Every interior headline is multi-line and uses the shared `HEADLINE_STEPPED` tier — subordinate to the hero, consistent across P2–P5. `HEADLINE_DISPLAY` exists for any future one-line interior statement.

**Global type + spacing tokens (global-refinement round — applied to ALL panels, never per-panel):**
- Display weight: ONE global **regular (400)** — set on `.font-display` (dropped from 500; medium still read heavier than Levels/Oura because uppercase reads denser than their sentence-case). Headline letter-spacing tightened to `-0.04em` (hero `-0.045em`), baked into the `HEADLINE_*` tokens — fixes the loose word gaps at display size. Green accent words unchanged.
- `BODY_TEXT` — supporting copy at font-light, comfortable size (thinner + larger reads calmer). Colour/contrast still set per mode at the call site.
- Vertical rhythm — **Levels-precision density.** `PANEL_PAD` = `py-8 md:py-12` (cut ~50% from `py-16 md:py-24`); `GAP_STACK` = `gap-4`; `GAP_SPLIT` = `gap-10 md:gap-12`. **Interior panels are content-driven** — only the hero forces viewport height; P2–P7 size to their content, so the two-colour band edge is the section separator and no viewport-fill dead space remains.
- Grid width: `GRID` = `max-w-7xl px-5 md:px-8` (was `max-w-6xl px-6 md:px-10`) — wider content, less side padding, matching the less-boxed Levels/Oura/Whoop feel.

### 2.3 Visual slot map (visuals round — LOCKED; placeholders only until then)

**Taste filter for ALL visuals: CALM, not shouty (Robinhood/Mercury restraint). Green used sparingly, never a loud fill.** Do not source or generate imagery outside the visuals round; all human imagery = licensed photography.

- **P1 Hero** — full-bleed dimmed **BACKGROUND VIDEO** behind the centred text. Ships on the gradient for v1. Marker "HERO BACKGROUND VIDEO — TBD".
- **P2 Problem** — a **SHAPE / ABSTRACT / REPRESENTATIVE image** framing the problem or its complexity. **NOT human, NOT a product screen.** Calm, black-green world. Full-width landscape below the text (§4). Marker "P2 — Abstract image framing the problem — TBD".
- **P3 How It Works** — real **HOME** screen in a device frame (locked asset). Layout = **robin hood 4**: phone LEFT pulled toward centre, large + slightly angled; text RIGHT toward centre; the two paired **CLOSE** (narrower centred container, not edge-to-edge).
- **P4 Evidence** — the STANDOUT panel, layout = **robin hood 2** on **pure jet black (`#000000`)** — the page's unique third register (flat, not the gradient fade), which is what makes the phone pop. Phone in a **WIDE** dark card (~`max-w-4xl`), **narrow + centred + STRAIGHT**, bleeding off the card's bottom edge with generous dark space on both sides. Card glow = subtle **neutral** light from bottom-centre (NOT green); the sparing green comes from the phone screen content. Matches robin hood 2 precisely. Real sleep chart (`Progress 1.png`) inside as **v1 placeholder**, marked on-screen "P4 — v1 static chart / to be replaced by live animation". **v2 = live proof animation in the same frame** (the ONLY product animation on the page). Jet black + a little green + the phone is the whole look.
- **P5 Promise** — three cards (layout locked): images **REPRESENTATIVE / ABSTRACT, Mercury-style, NOT human**. Labels your body / your goals / your results. Marker "Representative / abstract — TBD (not human)".
- **P6 Get Prism** — **robin hood 3** CENTRED conversion block: centred eyebrow → two-line header → slim email field + slim button. **No images** (the three placeholders were removed; the ref crop is a centred header, and it carries fabricated "27 million" social proof we must NOT copy).
- **P7 FAQ + Footer** — no imagery. Flat black register (restored — it was always black).

**Visual type language for the round:** primary = **PRODUCT SCREENS** (P3, P4). **HUMANS secondary** — but per this round P2 and P5 are **abstract/representative, not human** (human photography deferred). Where human + product ever co-occur, product = carved real Prism UI fragment, never fabricated. Human imagery = licensed photography.

**Locked rules (visuals round):**
- **No fabricated social proof** — no testimonials, member counts, or stat percentages until real data exists (post-launch). Verified: none on the page.
- **Device frames sit STRAIGHT (not tilted) with a soft shadow/glow so they're grounded, never floating.** (Superseded the brief 'slightly angled' call — founder chose straight.)

In code: the grid and shared primitives live in [app/sections/system.js](app/sections/system.js) (`GRID`, `Contained`, `HumanPlaceholder`, `Eyebrow`, `HEADLINE_DISPLAY`/`HEADLINE_STEPPED`, `--prism-radius`, `IS_LAUNCHED`). Every panel composes from them — never restyle margins/gutters/headline-scale per panel.

## 3. Brand (locked)

### 3.1 Design tokens (extracted from shipped App Store screens, sRGB)

- DARK mode canvas: vertical, `#000000` (top) → `#0A3C0A` (bottom). `linear-gradient(180deg, #000000, #0A3C0A)` matches the screens near-exactly. Each dark panel's band sits somewhere in this range.
- Cream (light register): near-white **`#FCFBF8`** with ink **`#14140F`** — stepped lighter twice (`#F7F2E8`→`#FAF8F3`→`#FCFBF8`), each read too warm/yellow; faint warmth only. Jet-black register (P4) is flat `#000000`. Gradient-dark leans richer green (to `#114F15`).
- Accent green (WORK / NOT / EVIDENCE only): `#3AB203` — an accent in BOTH modes, never a background.
- Display type colour: `#FFFFFF` on dark panels, the ink colour on light panels; all caps for headlines in both modes.
- **Trap** — in-app greens (`#5FDC02`, `#A8F161`, `#7AC95D`) belong to app screens only. They arrive on the site inside screenshots. Never use them for website type, buttons, or accents.
- **Type (SHIPPED — reconciled against [app/layout.js](app/layout.js), 2026-08-23; supersedes every Archivo call in this document):** **ONE sans family — Inter** — via `next/font/google`, used for everything: headlines, body, eyebrows, buttons, nav, footer. **Hierarchy is carried by WEIGHT ONLY** — headlines 600–700 (the hero H1 is 700, set inline because `.font-display`'s weight overrides the `font-bold` utility), body 400, eyebrow labels 500. Weights 300–800 are loaded so the headline weights are real, not synthesised.
- **Serif accent (SHIPPED):** **Newsreader**, italic, used **sparingly as an accent** alongside Inter — matching the serif in the app screens ("Sleep", "Improving"), in the Oura/Levels editorial register. Closest-match per §3.1a. It is a separate mechanism from the green accent-word treatment; do not conflate them.
- Both faces are self-hosted by `next/font` at build — no runtime third-party requests. **Archivo and Archivo Black are dead. Do not reintroduce them.**
- Body type and CTA button styling: closest-match from reference images; flag choices.
- One green accent word per headline, only where meaning lives: WORK, NOT, EVIDENCE.
- CTA: **white button, `rounded-xl`** — SHIPPED, per [app/sections/Hero.js](app/sections/Hero.js). The earlier "white pill" call is dead **for the hero**. The pill survives in Panel 6, whose field and button are both `rounded-full` ([app/sections/GetPrism.js](app/sections/GetPrism.js)). CTA shape is therefore per-component, not one global token.

### 3.1a Design rule — closest-match is correct behaviour

"Do not guess" applies to **FACTS** (prices, claims, product truths, copy) — never to design. For design, closest-match from reference is CORRECT behaviour: pick the nearest available typeface, spacing, sizing, composition to the reference material, implement it, and flag what was chosen. The founder judges on the preview; **iteration is the method.** Never block a panel on a design unknown.

### 3.1b Source roles for reference material

- **`brief-assets/` (App Store screens + PDF): LOOK AND FEEL.** Colour, type style, weight, mood. The visual language source.
- **`brief-assets/layout-reference/` (Levels, Oura, Whoop screenshots): LAYOUT, HIERARCHY, COMPOSITION, SECTION-SEPARATION reference ONLY.** Zero palette, zero typefaces, zero imagery from them — match how they arrange, not how they look. Studied 2026-07-17: eyebrow → dominant headline → subordinate support as one left-aligned unit; alternating split sides; same-tone sections separated by clear tint shifts, hard edges.
- **The old site (recoverable at `main` `72cde1e`, pre-cut — read `git show 72cde1e:app/page.js`): STRUCTURAL SKELETON.** Section anatomy only: full-viewport hero (visual + dark overlay + centred stacked headline/sub/CTA + quiet bottom strip), stacked full-width banded sections, big centred statement headlines, three-column step row (visual → small eyebrow badge → title → sub-line). **Take structure only. No palette, no imagery, no fonts, no copy from it.**

### 3.2 Asset manifest

All visual assets live in [brief-assets/](brief-assets/) in the project root. Never invent UI or imagery. A device frame around real app screenshots is allowed and expected. If an asset is missing, build with a grey placeholder of correct proportions and flag it — never generate a substitute.

`Prism - App Store Screens.pdf` is the composed App Store screens — **style reference only** (amended round: the hero bottles are removed permanently; no extraction happens). Not yet visually verified in-session (no PDF renderer in this environment).

Asset usage (structural revision: only ONE screen enters the build):

| Asset | Role |
|---|---|
| `Progress 1.png` | **The only app screen in the build** — Panel 4, in a device frame. Copied to `public/screens/progress.png`. Sleep chart with Magnesium marker, shipped App Store version (bright data-green, 8h 12m dataset). |
| `Prism - App Store Screens.pdf` | Look/feel style reference only (bottle extraction cancelled — hero is video-slot + gradient). |
| `Home.png`, `Gap.png`, `Plan.png`, `Goal 2.png` | **Style reference only. Never enter the build.** |
| OG/share image | Was bottles + headline; **needs redefinition now the hero is video-based** — founder direction required. |


## 4. Page structure and locked copy (7 panels, one scroll — FINAL, 2026-07-17 revision; supersedes all previous panel maps)

Each panel follows the §2 grammar: its own colour band, one message, self-contained. **No pinning, no scroll-driven swapping.** Story through sequence.

### Panel 1 — HERO (SHIPPED — reconciled against [app/sections/Hero.js](app/sections/Hero.js), 2026-08-23)

**This entry records what is LIVE.** It supersedes the pre-launch hero spec — centred stack, dimmed background video, all-caps green-accent headline, nav CTA, "no supporting line" — every part of which the shipped site moved past. Do not restore any of it from older sections of this document.

- **Background: the PRISM ARTWORK on flat black** (`bg-black`) — not the black→green gradient, not video. **Desktop:** `/hero/prism-hero.png` as a right-weighted full-bleed CSS background (`34vw`, positioned `85.4% center` — sized in `vw` so the geometry is independent of viewport height); the left half is feathered to clean black so copy never sits over lit pixels. **Mobile:** `/hero/prism-mobile.png`, uncropped and centred ABOVE the copy, height-capped (`29vh`, max `290px`) so the hero fits one viewport.
- **Alignment: copy is LEFT-aligned on desktop, centred on mobile.** This supersedes the §2.2 "Centred: P1 ONLY" rule at desktop width.
- Nav: **the PRISM wordmark ONLY.** No "Join waitlist" item, no other items, no hamburger.
- Headline — **sentence case, white, weight 700, NO green accent word**: **See if your supplements are working.** Desktop forces the line break after "supplements"; mobile wraps naturally.
- **Supporting line — it EXISTS.** The old "No supporting line. Deliberate. Do not add one." rule is dead: **Prism shows how supplements affect your health, so you can keep what works and change what doesn't.**
- CTA: one white button — **`rounded-xl`, not the §3.1 white pill** — reading **Join the waitlist**. **It collects no email.** It jumps to `#get-prism` and focuses that field (`focus({preventScroll:true})` first, inside the tap, then smooth scroll).

### Panel 2 — BRIDGE (LIGHT, **stacked** — Whoop horizontal pattern, global-refinement round)

- Eyebrow: **THE PROBLEM** (small caps)
- Levels text hierarchy, ONE coherent left-aligned text unit above the image:
  - Headline (dominant): **Are your supplements making a difference?**
  - Supporting block directly beneath: **The only way to check was a blood test. Expensive, complicated, hard to understand.** then **The answer has been on your wrist all along.** — the final line takes the green accent treatment.
- **Below the text, at full content width: the page's ONE landscape image** (standard card radius, ~16:9), breaking P3/P4's portrait rhythm. Currently a clearly-marked **"HUMAN VISUAL TBD — horizontal"** placeholder; reserved for a wide human/lifestyle image supplied later. Never source or generate imagery.

### Panel 3 — HOW IT WORKS (DARK — consolidated band map)

- Eyebrow (the section's small label): **HOW IT WORKS**
- **The HERE'S HOW headline is DELETED** (it answered its own question — do not reinstate).
- Headline-weight line: **Based on your health data**
- Support: **Cost-effective. Simple. Easy to understand.**
- Then the wearable brand row (Fix 5): Apple Watch / WHOOP / Oura / Garmin as text-styled wordmarks (factual claim — confirm final integration list before ship).
- Visual LEFT: **Home.png in a device frame** (per the §2.1 screens allowance). Text right.

### Panel 4 — PROOF (LIGHT — the page's app-screen peak)

- Eyebrow: **THE EVIDENCE**

- Headline pair: **SEE WHAT'S WORKING** then **AND WHAT'S NOT** (green: NOT)
- `Progress 1.png` in a device frame — **contained-card treatment: grounded (device rises from the card's bottom edge), subtle shadow, deliberate scale.** Never alter screen contents (edge-cropping by the card is containment, not alteration). Split: text left / visual right.
- Small annotation near the chart: **Two-week rolling average against your baseline.**
- Rule: app-screen copy is never edited on the website. If a line inside a real screen trips a copy rule, flag it as an app question. Do not patch it on the site.

### Panel 5 — TRUST (DARK, **left-aligned** — Whoop-pattern, P5-round recomposition)

- **Entire panel left-aligned within the grid** (eyebrow, headline, paragraph, cards). Not centred. (The old rationale, "the hero is the only centred panel", no longer holds — see §2.2 — but P5 itself is still left-aligned.)
- Eyebrow: **OUR PROMISE**
- Headline pair (stepped-down scale, caps kept, green EVIDENCE): **WE DON'T SELL SUPPLEMENTS** / **WE SHOW YOU THE EVIDENCE** — "THE EVIDENCE" protected from orphaning (nbsp + nowrap).
- Elaboration is **ONE paragraph**, exact: **Supplements are sold with sales and marketing. Studies on someone else, somewhere else. Not you. Not your data. So how can you be sure it's working? Prism just shows you what's changing, using your data.** — smaller reading size, ~60ch measure, left-aligned.
- **"No more guessing. Just evidence, from your body." stays DELETED** — Panel 6's header is the only "no more guessing" on the page.
- **The strap dissolves into the card labels.** Three cards in a left-aligned row (Whoop-card proportions, ~4:5), each carrying its label top-left inside the card: **YOUR BODY / YOUR GOALS / YOUR RESULTS**. HUMAN VISUAL TBD until the founder supplies imagery (§2.1).
- Height content-driven, not viewport-filling.

### Panel 6 — GET PRISM (LIGHT)

- Eyebrow: **GET STARTED**

- Header: **No more guessing. See for yourself.** (**flagged: repeats a Panel 5 line — build as-is, founder resolves on preview**)
- One email field, one button (**Join the waitlist**). The only input on the entire site. Backend: `app/api/waitlist` (Airtable, with the existing §8.10 preview gate).
- At launch this block swaps to: App Store badge dominant; pricing cards beneath — annual £49.99 highlighted with 7-day free trial flagged and the honest arithmetic shown (£4.17/month, billed annually); monthly £6.99 secondary. No urgency language.
- Nav "Join waitlist" item swaps to the App Store link at launch. Build the swap as **one flag, not scattered edits**.

### Panel 7 — FAQ + FOOTER (DARK — black band, white type, sparing green accents on accordion interactions)

- Eyebrow: **COMMON QUESTIONS**

- Accordion, closed by default, quiet type. **These six locked questions**, with clearly-marked placeholder answers (founder supplies final copy — do not write final answers):
  1. Do I need a wearable?
  2. Does Prism sell supplements or tell me what to buy?
  3. Is this medical advice?
  4. How does Prism show what's working?
  5. When will I see results?
  6. Why do results vary from person to person?
- Product-truth checks before ship: (a) is a wearable strictly required, or is iPhone/Apple Health data alone sufficient; (b) "when will I see results" uses the concrete day-14 answer.
- Footer: Privacy, Terms, Contact, medical disclaimer. Small, grey, functional. Privacy and Terms are legally required (the waitlist email is personal data under UK GDPR; Apple expects a reachable privacy URL). Rewrite reference: `docs/legacy-legal-copy.md`.

### Deleted from the site entirely (this revision)

The steps section (Tell us what you take / Review your plan / Track your results). **"No blood tests. No guesswork."** All app screenshots except `Progress 1.png` (others remain in `brief-assets/` as style reference only). The old bridge lines and the benched Beat 3 bubble/whisper are superseded — HERE'S HOW and the integrations strip returned as Panel 3; nothing else from the bench survives.

## 5. Copy rules (locked — apply to every word on the page)

- Plain British English. Short sentences. One idea per sentence.
- No mid-sentence em dashes.
- Probabilistic and observational language only. Never causal, never directive. "See what's changing", never "we prove", "proven to", "we know", "which ones work".
- The words "first" and "proof/prove" never appear in live copy.
- Direct address to the reader. Never "most people" or third-person market description.
- Never attack or blame the reader. Concerns are raised about the situation or the industry, never the person.
- Banned: leverage, optimise, unlock, urgency language, marketing intensifiers, wellness clichés.
- Prism presents options, never instructs.
- **The site's voice never refers to Prism in the third person as the speaker** (locked §4 copy stands as written).
- Green accent appears only on WORK, NOT, EVIDENCE.

### Collision checks (judge on the preview, resolve in situ)

1. ~~The "No more guessing" repeat~~ — resolved by the consolidated round: the Panel 5 closing line is deleted; the Panel 6 header is the only "no more guessing" on the page.
2. ~~The Panel 2 / Panel 5 "working" echo~~ — resolved: the final Panel 2 copy opens with "making a difference", the echo is gone.

## 6. Delete list (everything web-first-product era)

Quiz and question flows. Goal selectors. Supplement lists and supplement pages. SSO, auth, logins, accounts. Any onboarding. All old marketing pages beyond what Section 4 specifies. All forest/nature photography and the old light palette. Old copy throughout.

§10 maps this list onto the actual files.

## 7. Confirmed infrastructure (verified from live setup — do not re-derive)

- Stack: Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, deployed on Vercel. **Prisma is NOT in the stack** — it went with the delete pass (see the Prisma bullet below); the old stack line listing it contradicted that.
- Repo: `nickjacobs24-collab/prism-web` on GitHub. This is the only repo in scope. `renew-backend` and `renew-ios` belong to the app dev agency and are never touched.
- Vercel project: `renew-app`, serving **prismhealthco.com**, deploying from `main`. **Every push to `main` is a production deploy** (§8.2). Branch previews still exist by default, but no staging branch is in use.
- Vercel holds 13 environment variables and a MailerSend integration. **Never delete, rewrite or commit `.env` / `.env.local`.**
- **Waitlist storage: Airtable (founder decision, supersedes the original brief).** The brief assumed MailerSend was the waitlist path; the code showed otherwise — MailerSend was only ever wired to NextAuth sign-in emails. Beat 8 posts to the existing Airtable table. `AIRTABLE_TOKEN` is the only backend credential the new site needs.
- **MailerSend is cut, not kept** — it dies with the NextAuth route. The Vercel MailerSend integration and its env vars can be retired once the delete pass is merged. Flag before touching anything in the Vercel dashboard; that is founder-side, not a repo change.
- **Prisma and the database are deleted entirely** (founder decision). No table backs the waitlist. Remove `prisma/`, `lib/prisma.js`, the `prisma generate` build step, and the `prisma` / `@prisma/client` dependencies. `DATABASE_URL` becomes dead.
- New domain at cutover: prismhealthco.com (DNS in the founder's Cloudflare account). Old domain renewhealth.app is killed at cutover, no redirect.

## 8. Build plan

1. ~~Baseline commit + push~~ **done** (`main` `72cde1e`).
2. ~~`rebuild` branch~~ **done, merged, and RETIRED (2026-08-23).** The branch-only rule is dead — do not reinstate it. **`main` is the single working branch and it is production: every push to `main` deploys to prismhealthco.com.** There is no staging branch and no preview gate between a commit and the live site. Work on `main`, and treat every push as a deploy.
3. ~~Delete pass~~ **done** (verified building clean).
4. **Panel gating: Panels 1–3 built fully dressed — matched display type (closest match to the App Store face, flagged), real composition, band treatment, spacing, polish. Pushed to `rebuild` for preview. STOP. The founder judges on the preview before Panels 4–7 build.**
5. Iterate on the branch preview URL. The founder judges copy and visuals there.
6. Mobile-first: most traffic arrives on phones via shared links. Spec the mobile scroll in parallel, not as a degradation of desktop. Mobile nav: logo + one CTA. No hamburger menu.
7. Nav: logo + "Join waitlist" only (per Panel 1 — the "How it works" item is gone). "Join waitlist" scrolls to Panel 6; dead until Panel 6 exists — acceptable during gating. At launch it becomes the App Store link (one flag, per Panel 6).
8. Motion: panels are static compositions; motion is limited to restrained entrance treatment (fade/rise on scroll-into-view) and ambient touches like the bottle drift. No pinning, no scroll-linked morphing (§2). `prefers-reduced-motion`: everything renders static. (The original pinned-sequence motion proof was built, then killed by the structural revision — do not resurrect it.)
9. Performance budget: LCP under 2.5s on mid-range mobile, 60fps scroll, CLS near zero. Jank kills belief on an evidence product.
10. **Waitlist writes: preview deployments must never write to the live Airtable table.** Gate on `VERCEL_ENV === 'production'`, not `NODE_ENV` — implemented in `app/api/waitlist/route.js`. Verify on the preview URL before the founder tests Panel 6.
11. Analytics: **SHIPPED — Vercel Analytics.** `@vercel/analytics` is a dependency and `<Analytics />` renders in [app/layout.js](app/layout.js). Nothing else is loaded; the old GA and Microsoft Clarity tags went with the delete pass and were not reinstated.
12. OG/share metadata carries the hero line and the OG image from the asset manifest.
13. Cutover: merge to `main`, point prismhealthco.com (DNS in Cloudflare) at the deployment. Rename the GitHub repo to a Prism name at cutover, not before.
14. Old domain (renewhealth.app): killed. No redirect. Site comes down; domain lapses.

## 9. Working rules for build sessions

- Do not relitigate locked decisions: the bare hero (no supporting line), the absence of a separate "what Prism is" section (the bridge does that job), the single-scroll structure, the locked copy in Sections 4 and 5.
- Where the spec marks something in situ, build the best candidate and flag it for founder judgement on the preview.
- If anything in the codebase contradicts this brief, flag it. Do not silently override in either direction.

## 10. Codebase after the delete pass

The delete pass (§8.3) ran on `rebuild` on 2026-07-17: 89 files cut — the entire Renew web-first product (quiz, results, 19 supplement modals, NextAuth/MailerSend, accounts, Prisma and its committed dev.db, old marketing pages, all 42 `public/images/`, favicon). The full Renew tree is recoverable from `main` at `72cde1e`.

Commands: `npm run dev`, `npm run build` (plain `next build` — the `prisma generate` hooks are gone), `npm run lint` (eslint — Next 16 never runs it during build; run it yourself). No test suite exists. Plain JavaScript, no TypeScript; `jsconfig.json` maps `@/*` to the repo root. Tailwind v4 via the PostCSS plugin, configured in `app/globals.css`, not a `tailwind.config.js`.

What exists now:

- [app/layout.js](app/layout.js) — Prism shell: fonts via `next/font/google` (self-hosted at build, no runtime third-party requests), title, hero-line description. **Vercel Analytics** via `<Analytics />` (§8.11).
- [app/page.js](app/page.js) — composes all seven panels from [app/sections/](app/sections/): `Hero`, `Bridge`, `HeresHow`, `Proof`, `Trust`, `GetPrism`, `FaqFooter`, plus `system.js` (grid/eyebrow/container primitives and the `IS_LAUNCHED` flag).
- [app/globals.css](app/globals.css) — Tailwind import, §3.1 tokens, font wiring, bottle-drift keyframes (with `prefers-reduced-motion` disable). Band gradients live per-panel in the section components, not on `body`.
- [public/screens/progress.png](public/screens/progress.png) — the one in-build app screen (Panel 4, not yet built).
- [app/api/waitlist/route.js](app/api/waitlist/route.js) — the Beat 8 backend: POSTs the email to Airtable, **already carrying the §8.10 gate** (`VERCEL_ENV !== "production"` → log-only, no Airtable write).
- [docs/legacy-legal-copy.md](docs/legacy-legal-copy.md) — the old Renew legal text, extracted as reference for the Beat 9 rewrite. Not surviving copy; not part of the built site.
- Dependencies: `next`, `react`, `react-dom`, plus `framer-motion` and `lucide-react` retained for the §8.8 motion decision. Everything auth/db/email is gone.
- `package.json` `name` stays `renew-app` until cutover (§8.13 renames the repo then, not before).

## 11. Open flags (raised per §9, not resolved in code)

1. ~~Hero footage TBD~~ — **SUPERSEDED. The hero ships built around the PRISM ARTWORK, not video.** Reconciled against [app/sections/Hero.js](app/sections/Hero.js), 2026-08-23:
   - **Desktop:** `/hero/prism-hero.png` as a right-weighted full-bleed CSS background (`34vw`, positioned `85.4% center` — sized in `vw` so the geometry is independent of viewport height), copy overlaid on a feathered black left half.
   - **Mobile:** its own treatment — `/hero/prism-mobile.png` uncropped and centred ABOVE the copy, height-capped so the hero fits one viewport. Never sets copy over the prism or its light path.
   - **The hero collects NO email.** A single "Join the waitlist" button jumps to `#get-prism` and focuses that field (`focus({preventScroll:true})` first, inside the tap, then smooth scroll). The inline hero email form was removed — do not reinstate it.
   - **Nav is the PRISM wordmark ONLY.** No "Join waitlist" nav item.
   - No background video; `HeroVideo.js` is no longer the hero's mechanism.
   - **Still open:** the OG/share image remains undefined.
2. ~~Display face TBC~~ — **RESOLVED AND SHIPPED. Do not reopen.** Typography is **Inter** as the single sans (hierarchy by weight only) with **Newsreader italic** as a sparing serif accent. See §3.1. This no longer blocks anything.
3. ~~Analytics TBC~~ — **RESOLVED AND SHIPPED. Vercel Analytics is live** (`@vercel/analytics`, `<Analytics />` in [app/layout.js](app/layout.js)). The old GA and Microsoft Clarity tags went with the delete pass and were not reinstated.
4. **Integration list is unconfirmed (§4 Beat 3).** **APPLE WATCH | WHOOP | OURA | GARMIN** is a factual claim and needs confirming before ship.
5. **FAQ copy is founder-supplied (§4 Beat 9).** Placeholders only, plus the two product-truth checks (wearable required or not; day-14 answer).
6. **Vercel-side cleanup after merge (founder-side, not repo work):** retire the MailerSend integration and its env vars, `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_*`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_*`. Only `AIRTABLE_TOKEN` (and any analytics var) remains needed. Flag, don't touch — the dashboard is the founder's.
7. **Closest-match design choices in Panels 1–3 (per §3.1a — judge on the preview, flagged not asked):** ~~display face Archivo Black~~ **(superseded — typography shipped as Inter + Newsreader italic accent; see §3.1)**; "PRISM" text wordmark in the nav (no logo asset supplied); band gradients — hero near-black deepening to green at its base, bridge continuing one step deeper and returning to black, Panel 3 stepping back into green; bottle placeholder proportions and slow-drift timing; stanza pacing (~70vh per stanza) and type scale throughout. **System tokens (§2.2):** grid `max-w-6xl` with `px-6 md:px-10` margins, panel rhythm `py-28 md:py-36`, container radius `1.25rem`; the wearable strip rendered as a pill-shaped designed element (`rounded-full` + faint ring) — pill radius for small designed elements, the radius token for contained visuals.
8. **Eyebrow treatment (closest-match, judge on preview):** 11px small caps, `0.3em` tracking, muted to 60% of the mode's type colour (white/60 dark, ink/60 light) — quiet-label convention; deliberately NOT the accent green, to keep WORK/NOT/EVIDENCE special. One primitive in `system.js`, same treatment both modes per spec.
9. **Panel 6 header repeat** ("No more guessing") — locked, built as-is when Panel 6 comes; founder resolves on preview (§5 collision check 1).
10. **Two-mode closest-match calls (judge on preview):** cream `#F7F2E8` / ink `#14140F` (§3.1 — exact warmth is the founder's call); panel transitions built as **hard band edges** (short fade is the fallback if harsh); dark-mode supporting copy at `white/90`+, light-mode at ink `/80`+ per the contrast rule; bridge pacing compressed to ~1.5 viewports total (~50vh per stanza beat).
11. **Green-on-cream contrast, live in Panel 4:** `#3AB203` on `#F7F2E8` measures ≈2.5:1 — fine as a display-size accent word by Levels/Oura convention, below WCAG AA large-text (3:1). Built with the locked token as specced. Founder call on preview: accept, or deepen the accent on light panels only (e.g. `#2E8F02`) — the §3.1 token would then be mode-dependent.
12. **Panels 4–7 closest-match calls (judge on preview):** Panel 4 split puts copy left / device frame right (first split on the page; "alternate sides" applies from the next split); Panel 5's band runs the full range to `#0A3C0A` as the page's deepest green moment; Panel 6's header set sentence-case semibold (a header line, not an all-caps display headline) and its CTA inverted to an ink pill on cream (the white pill is invisible on light ground); Panel 7 accordion uses native `<details>`, no JS.
13. **Drafted UI microcopy in Panel 6 (not locked §4 copy — founder approves):** placeholder "Email address", submitting "Joining…", success "You're on the list.", error "Something went wrong. Please try again."
14. **Footer is placeholder-grade:** `/privacy` and `/terms` links 404 until those pages are written (legally required before ship); Contact is a mailto to the founder's address (carried from the old site — confirm); the medical disclaimer renders as a marked placeholder, not drafted copy; "© 2026 Prism" is not yet rendered — add with the legal pages.

15. **Brand row wordmarks are TEXT approximations** (weight/tracking styling per brand, ŌURA with macron) — official logo SVGs cannot be rendered accurately from code and were not fabricated; swap in licensed assets when supplied. Now on P3's dark band.
16. **Consolidated-round notes (judge on preview):** the two-cream-depth mechanism and the trend-crop bridge visual are dead (superseded); the bridge's final accent line still sits at ~2.5:1 on cream (same §11.11 question); P4's grounded device rises from its card's bottom edge (containment, not content alteration); P7's accordion marker turns accent green on open — the "sparing green accents on interactions" call.
17. **Human imagery pending founder direction** — P2 slot and P5 strip render HUMAN VISUAL TBD blocks; never source or generate imagery.

### Logged app-side questions (not website work)

- `Gap.png` reads "A key supplement is missing. / Magnesium. / For your sleep goal." — "is missing" is an assertion rather than observational language, and sits close to the §5 "presents options, never instructs" rule. **Founder decision: use the screen as-is on the site; logged as an app question only.** Per the Beat 5 rule, never patch app-screen copy on the website.

### Resolved (do not reopen)

- Waitlist stays on **Airtable**; Prisma, the database, and the MailerSend/NextAuth integration are all cut; `resend`, `nodemailer` and `react-icons` dependencies dropped. See §7.
- Preview deployments must not write to the live Airtable table — gate implemented in `app/api/waitlist/route.js`. See §8.10.
- The second Airtable capture (`api/auth/login`, "User Login" table) deleted with sign-in — founder-confirmed. The waitlist route is the only capture that survives.
- `applegal` legal copy extracted to `docs/legacy-legal-copy.md` as rewrite reference before deletion — founder decision: reference only, not surviving copy.
- Favicon deleted; previews show the default icon until a Prism one is supplied.
- `framer-motion` and `lucide-react` kept; pruning them is a rebuild-pass call (§8.8).
- `PRISM_WEBSITE_BRIEF.md` deleted; this file is the single source of truth.
- `Lifestyle.png` removed from `brief-assets/`; no beat uses it. Recoverable from `main` at `72cde1e`.
- **Hero bottles removed permanently** (amended round, 2026-07-17): placeholder deleted, PDF p.1 extraction cancelled, PDF stays as style reference. Hero is video-slot + gradient. Do not reintroduce bottles.
- **Composition (P5 round) — PARTLY SUPERSEDED BY THE BUILD, do not apply the alignment half.** The "hero is the ONLY centred panel, P6 moved off-centre" rule did NOT survive: the shipped hero is left-aligned at desktop and P6 is centred (§2.2, §4 Panel 1). What still holds: headline scale is calibrated hero-peak / stepped-interior via `HEADLINE_STEPPED`.
- Baseline committed and pushed to `main`; `rebuild` branch created (§8.1, §8.2).
- Delete pass executed and verified building clean (§8.3), 2026-07-17.
- The pinned-phone sequence (original §8.8 motion proof) was built, then **deleted by the 2026-07-17 structural revision** — the five-screen demonstration misread the concept. Panels only. Do not resurrect.
- The final-structure revision (same day) then: replaced the bridge copy (wrist/blood-test version is final), deleted the steps section and "No blood tests. No guesswork.", dissolved the Beat 3 bench (HERE'S HOW + strip returned as Panel 3; bubble and whisper superseded), locked the Panel 6 header, and supplied the six FAQ questions. §4 is FINAL — earlier panel maps are dead.
- The design-system correction (same day) replaced the single continuous dark canvas with **alternating LIGHT/DARK mode chaptering** (§2 mode map), killed washed-grey secondary text, and compressed the bridge to ~1.5 viewports. Do not rebuild an all-dark page.
- The copy/grammar correction (same day) replaced Panel 3's drafted lines with the verbatim App Store screen-2 narrative ("Based on your health data" / "Cost-effective. Simple. Easy to understand."), made eyebrows required on every panel except the hero (labels locked in §4), and added the §5 voice rule (the site's voice never refers to Prism in the third person as the speaker).
- `Home.png`, `Gap.png`, `Plan.png`, `Goal 2.png` removed from `public/screens/` — style reference only, they stay in `brief-assets/`.
