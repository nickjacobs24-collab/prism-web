/*
 * Panel 7 — FAQ + FOOTER (§4). BLACK — it was always black; the cream
 * flip was wrong. P4's jet black is the standout by being framed green
 * (P3) → black (P4) → green (P5), not by being the only black on the
 * page, so a black footer at the very bottom is fine. Quiet utility:
 * left-aligned accordion (native <details>, closed by default), green
 * only on the open-state marker. Footer sits within the black.
